## What is boringNotch+?

**boringNotch+** is my enhanced fork of the original [BoringNotch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch) app. It's a macOS menu bar utility that transforms the screen notch into something smart, dynamic, and personal. I added new widgets, polished existing ones, improved performance, and fixed annoying bugs.
